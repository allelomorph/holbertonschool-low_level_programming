## Description
What you should learn from this project:

* What are macros and how to use them

### [1. pi](./1-pi.h)
* Create a header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.


### [2. main](./2-main.c)
* Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.
  * You are allowed to use the standard library


### [3. function_like_macro](./3-function_like_macro.h)
* Write a function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.
