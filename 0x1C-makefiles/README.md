* [`m.h`](./m.h)
* [`main.c`](./main.c)

## Mandatory Tasks

### :white_check_mark: 0. make -f 0-Makefile
Create your first Makefile.

Requirements:

* name of the executable: `school`
* rules: `all`
    * The `all` rule builds your executable
* variables: none

File(s): [`0-Makefile`](./0-Makefile)\
Compiled: `make -f 0-Makefile`

### :white_check_mark: 1. make -f 1-Makefile
Requirements:

* name of the executable: `school`
* rules: `all`
    * The `all` rule builds your executable
* variables: `CC`, `SRC`
    * `CC`: the compiler to be used
    * `SRC`: the `.c` files

File(s): [`1-Makefile`](./1-Makefile)\
Compiled: `make -f 1-Makefile`

### :white_check_mark: 2. make -f 2-Makefile
Create your first useful Makefile.

Requirements:

* name of the executable: `school`
* rules: `all`
    * The `all` rule builds your executable
* variables: `CC`, `SRC`, `OBJ`, `NAME`
    * `CC`: the compiler to be used
    * `SRC`: the `.c` files
    * `OBJ`: the `.o` files
    * `NAME`: the name of the executable
* The `all` rule should recompile only the updated source files
* You are not allowed to have a list of all the `.o` files

File(s): [`2-Makefile`](./2-Makefile)\
Compiled: `make -f 2-Makefile`

### :white_check_mark: 3. make -f 3-Makefile
Requirements:

* name of the executable: `school`
* rules: `all`, `clean`, `oclean`, `fclean`, `re`
    * `all`: builds your executable
    * `clean`: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files along with the executable
    * `oclean`: deletes the object files
    * `fclean`: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files, the executable, and the object files
    * `re`: forces recompilation of all source files
* variables: `CC`, `SRC`, `OBJ`, `NAME`, `RM`
    * `CC`: the compiler to be used
    * `SRC`: the `.c` files
    * `OBJ`: the `.o` files
    * `NAME`: the name of the executable
    * `RM`: the program to delete files
* The `all` rule should recompile only the updated source files
* The `clean`, `oclean`, `fclean`, `re` rules should never fail
* You are not allowed to have a list of all the `.o` files

File(s): [`3-Makefile`](./3-Makefile)\
Compiled: `make -f 3-Makefile`

### :white_check_mark: 4. A complete Makefile
Requirements:

* name of the executable: `school`
* rules: `all`, `clean`, `fclean`, `oclean`, `re`
    * `all`: builds your executable
    * `clean`: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files along with the executable
    * `oclean`: deletes the object files
    * `fclean`: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files, the executable, and the object files
    * `re`: forces recompilation of all source files
* variables: `CC`, `SRC`, `OBJ`, `NAME`, `RM`, `CFLAGS`
    * `CC`: the compiler to be used
    * `SRC`: the .c files
    * `OBJ`: the .o files
    * `NAME`: the name of the executable
    * `RM`: the program to delete files
    * `CFLAGS`: your favorite compiler flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic`
* The `all` rule should recompile only the updated source files
* The `clean`, `oclean`, `fclean`, `re` rules should never fail
* You are not allowed to have a list of all the `.o` files

File(s): [`4-Makefile`](./4-Makefile)\
Compiled: `make all -f 4-Makefile`

### :white_check_mark: 5. Island Perimeter
**Technical interview preparation**:

* You are not allowed to google anything
* Whiteboard first

Create a function `def island_perimeter(grid):` that returns the perimeter of the island described in grid:

* `grid` is a list of list of integers:
    * 0 represents a water zone
    * 1 represents a land zone
    * One cell is a square with side length 1
    * Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
    * Grid is rectangular, width and height don’t exceed 100
* Grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is one island (or nothing).
* The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to the water around the island).

Requirements:

* First line contains `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* You are not allowed to import any module
* Module and function must be documented

File(s): [`5-island_perimeter.py`](./5-island_perimeter.py)

## Advanced Tasks

### :white_check_mark: 6. make -f 100-Makefile
Requirements:

* name of the executable: `school`
* rules: `all`, `clean`, `fclean`, `oclean`, `re`
    * `all`: builds your executable
    * `clean`: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files along with the executable
    * `oclean`: deletes the object files
    * `fclean`: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files, the executable, and the object files
    * `re`: forces recompilation of all source files
* variables: `CC`, `SRC`, `OBJ`, `NAME`, `RM`, `CFLAGS`
    * `CC`: the compiler to be used
    * `SRC`: the `.c` files
    * `OBJ`: the `.o` files
    * `NAME`: the name of the executable
    * `RM`: the program to delete files
    * `CFLAGS`: your favorite compiler flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic`
* The `all` rule should recompile only the updated source files
* The `clean`, `oclean`, `fclean`, `re` rules should never fail
* You are not allowed to have a list of all the `.o` files
* You have to use `$(RM)` for the cleaning up rules, but you are not allowed to set the `RM` variable
* You are not allowed to use the string `$(CC)` more than once in your Makefile
* You are only allowed to use the string `$(RM)` twice in your Makefile
* You are not allowed to use the string `$(CFLAGS)` (but the compiler should still use the flags you set in this variable)
* You are not allowed to have an `$(OBJ)` rule
* You are not allowed to use the `%.o: %.c` rule
* Your Makefile should work even if there is a file in the folder that has the same name as one of your rule
* Your Makefile should not compile if the header file `m.h` is missing

File(s): [`100-Makefile`](./100-Makefile)\
Compiled: `make -f 100-Makefile`
